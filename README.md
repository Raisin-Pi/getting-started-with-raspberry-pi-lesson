![](cover.png)

Cette leçon a été conçue comme étant une présentation initiale du Raspberry Pi. It could be taught as a standalone lesson, as a workshop, or as part of a wider scheme of work to introduce students to Raspberry Pi and explain its main features and setup.

## Students will learn:

In this lesson, students will learn

- What a Raspberry Pi is
- Its main features
- How to set up and use one

## Computing programme of study met:

### KS2

## Resources

For the majority of the lesson, it is suggested that work is carried out by students on a Raspberry Pi in pairs. Each pair should have access to the standard equipment described below. In addition, it is suggested that you have your own teacher setup connected to a projector screen for demonstration purposes.

- A Raspberry Pi per pair
- A NOOBS SD card per Raspberry Pi (with an up-to-date Raspbian installed)
- A keyboard and mouse connected to each Raspberry Pi
- A monitor connected to each Raspberry Pi
- A micro USB power adaptor
- All necessary cables

See [raspberrypi.org/downloads](http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) to download NOOBS/Raspbian and see the [NOOBS setup guide](http://www.raspberrypi.org/help/noobs-setup/) for help with installation.
